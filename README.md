# zero-loss-0

Welcome to the Zero-Loss-0 Lottery Web3 Project repository on GitHub! This project is a decentralized lottery raffle contract that leverages users' pooled money. The unique feature of this lottery is that it utilizes Chainlink VRF (Verifiable Random Function) and Chainlink Automation to automatically select a random winner. The name "Zero-Loss" comes from the fact that all participants will receive their invested amount back, thanks to liquidity providers such as Compound Finance and Aave Finance protocols. Additionally, the lottery automatically transfers funds to these liquidity providers, along with interest accrued from the pool, after a set time.
